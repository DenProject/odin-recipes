    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <p>Based on my experience, "tips" are smaller trimmings cut from pieces of meat that weren't big enough to make larger chunks of "stew meat."</p>
    <p>Nowadays, beef tips can come from any cut, but for obvious financial reasons, your average truck stop is using something cheap, lean, and tough (so that's what I went with here).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds beef round steak</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice beef into 3/4-inch strips; then slice these pieces, at an angle, into smaller "tips." Season beef with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until shimmering</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium and add tomato paste, garlic, and butter</li>
    </ol>
